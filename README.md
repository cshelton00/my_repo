responsive page project has only been tested in google chrome after I get it all built im going to start fixing it for other browers will be awhile as im terrified to see how it looks in IE

i do not know PHP that file was made with help from a LAMP developer for me to learn when I get to that point

baseline is broken I'm using that for experimenting with code before i bring it to the responsive page file


comic is a side project it will be updated very slowly(all art will be made hand made can't code till I have the art)
